The function should handle any potential errors that occur during the calculation. To do this, you can use a try-except block. If any exception arises during the calculation, it should catch the error using the generic exception class `\"Exception\" as \"e\"`. When an exception occurs, the function should display `\"An error occurred during calculation.`\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def math_task(num):\n    try:\n        result=num/(num-5)\n        print(\"result is \",result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"An error occured during calculation\")\nnum=int(input(\"enter number to calculate the complex math\"))\nmath_task(num)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-26T10:45:17.391245Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-26T10:45:17.391549Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-26T10:45:18.889851Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-26T10:45:17.391525Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-26T10:45:18.888920Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"enter number to calculate the complex math 10\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"result is  2.0\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":72},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Note:- Practice handling exceptions by trying different input types like using integers, strings, zero, negative values, or other data types.**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<details><summary>Click here for the hints</summary>\n\n```python\nFollow these:-\n* Define a function for the complex calculation and pass any argument.\n* Use a try-except block for error handling.\n* Perform the calculation and store the result in \"result.\"\n* Catch any exceptions using Exception as e.\n* Display \"An error occurred during calculation.\" when an exception is caught.\n* take user input\n* Call the defined function with the user input\n**Note:- Test with different inputs to validate error handling.**\n```\n\n</details>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Authors\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-s-50398b136/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Santarcangelo</a>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Change Log\n\n|  Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |  Version | Changed By  |  Change Description |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2024-01-16 | 2.3 | Ghulam Ali | Updated some content and instructions |\n| 2023-11-02 | 2.2 | Abhishek Gagneja | Updated instructions |\n| 2023-08-01 | 2.1   | Akansha Yadav | Added optional practice section |\n| 2020-09-02  | 2.0  | Simran | Template updates to the file|\n|   |   |   |   |\n\n\n\n\n## <h3 align=\"center\"> © IBM Corporation 2023.
